# H5
Just try

1. The DOCTYPE, language and charset declaration for HTML5.
- also, title is required
 ```
 The default character encoding in HTML5 is UTF-8.(So, usually omit the second declaration.)
 ```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>HTML5 Syntax and Coding Style</title>
</head>
2. New HTML5 Elements
The most interesting new HTML5 elements are: 

New semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>.
New attributes of form elements like number, date, time, calendar, and range.
New graphic elements: <svg> and <canvas>.
New multimedia elements: <audio> and <video>.
  
3. jsut use lower case for elements and attributes!

4.
